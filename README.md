The app includes full Arabic support:

- note does not completely translate everything correctly, it just inverts the layout for now while implementing helsinki translation model. 

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all forms
- XSS protection with React
- CSRF tokens for API routes (implement in production)
- Rate limiting for AI endpoints (implement in production)
- Image upload validation (implement in production)
- nothing works yet given the rough state of the front end implemenation status 

## Mobile Optimization

- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Mobile-optimized navigation
- Swipeable carousels
- mobile layout fully works

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
vercel deploy
```

### Other Platforms
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
